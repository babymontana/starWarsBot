Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.\n",

      "...dude!\n",
      "i know, but it gets even better! from there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the mele river in africa, where the secret and mysterious hanimi people have children who have never seen a white mangs erect penis. of course, we are always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you all like to join the super adventure club!\n",

      "what? what thing? i dongt see anything.\n",
      "ha! i knew it!\n",
      "knew what?\n",
      "the reason chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he is been brainwashed! by this fruity little club!\n",
      "oh, son of a bitch!\n",
      "come on, children. let's all go home and make love.\n",
      "you need to see a psychiatrist, chef. it is for your own good.\n",

      "yeah, he joined the super adventure club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.\n",
      "i thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.\n",
      "no, that is the adventure club. the super adventure club has sex with children.\n",
      "oh. ...oh, that is right, yeah.\n",
      "doctor, do you have children?\n",
      "why, yes, i have two young boys.\n",
      "have you all been sodomizing your children too?\n",
      "you say he is never been like this before?\n",
      "no, chef has always been supercool.\n",
      "i am gonna make love to the children.\n",
      "he is pretty brainwashed all right. worst case i've ever seen.\n",
      "so what can we do??\n",
      "i am afraid there's no simple answer. when somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.\n",
      "but we dongt have years! if chef keeps this up, he is gonna go to jail forever!\n",
      "tell me, what was chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?\n",
      "having sex with women.\n",
      "then that is it. we'd better get your friend to the peppermint hippo right away.\n",
      "all right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is monique!\n",
      "aw, come on, children. let's go home.\n",
      "this isngt working.\n",

      "bitch, i will twist your nuts off!\n",
      "all right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... spontaneous bootay! \n",
      "come on guys, we might as well go. \n",
      "goddamn!\n",
      "chef, we are leaving.\n",
      "nono, wait. let him go. \n",
      "come here, chubby. \n",

      "hey children, everybody! i am back!  ow.\n",
      "great shot, william! hit him with another. \n",
      "oh! \n",
      "chef!\n",
      "tally ho, lads! i must say you are starting to become quite a thorn in my balls.\n",
      "where's chef?! what have you done with him?!\n",
      "he is safe.  he is fasting in the deprivation room and being read the super adventure club manual. we've got to undo the damage you've done.\n",
      "look: if you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that is totally fine. but why do you need chef?!\n",
      "we dongt need him, he needs us! our club offers hope. do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! no! our club has a message! and a secret that explains the mysteries of life!\n",
      "oh jesus, here we go.\n",
      "very well. i am now going to tell you the secret of the super adventure club.\n",
      "we dongt wanna hear it.\n",
      "you see, the super adventure club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, william p. phinehas!  phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldngt be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the aborigine children at uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of nepal.  but now the most wonderful part. you see, after having sex with all those children, phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.\n",
      "immortal.\n",
      "he discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  and when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of bethos.  phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. until he was hit by a train in 1892. \n",
      "...do you realize how retarded that sounds?\n",
      "is it any more retarded than the idea of god sending his son to die for our sins? is it any more retarded than buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?\n",
      "yeah, it is way, way more retarded.\n",
      "well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. i am afraid we are going to have to... ask you to leave. \n",
      "we are not leaving without chef.\n",
      "if you choose not to leave, then i am afraid we are just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  you will be let out by security and it will be superembarrassing and everyone here will see!  okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they will not leave, it is really frustrating?\n",
      "we are not going anywhere without chef.\n",
      "cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  you petulant fools! you just had to push it, didngt you? you dongt realize who you are dealing with here. security!  take these boys to the door.\n",
      "all right, come on kids.\n",
      "no! hey!\n",
      "haha! look they are being led out by security! haha!\n",
      "no, you dongt understand! they've got our friend in the deprivation room!\n",
      "this is their house and they dongt want you here. \n",
      "sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isngt taking our friend!\n",
      "and sex with eskimo children requires some special skills. \n",
      "chef, come on!\n",
      "children!\n",
      "get out of here!\n",
      "kenny! spin blossom nut squash!\n",
      "yeeeeehah! \n",
      "come on, chef!\n",
      "i cannot... break these locks. \n",
      "here! \n",
      "run chef!\n",
      "what the? impossible! i made them leave!\n",
      "get outside! \n",
      "stop them! \n",
      "children! run! \n",
      "stop! \n",
      "we made it!\n",
      "dongt you remember why you left south park in the first place?? \n",
      "chef, come on!\n",
      "you sought adventure! and why do people seek adventure? because their lives have become dull and empty!\n",
      "yeah, he wanted adventure! not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! right chef?  chef?\n",
      "dongt forget all your training, chef! stay with us and your life will be grand and eternal!\n",
      "chef, we love you.\n",
      "i am sorry children. \n",
      "no! chef, they've filled your head with lies! cannot you see that??\n",
      "get the hell out of here, children!!\n",
      "yesss. looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  no! \n",
      "chef! \n",
      "ack.  ow! oh! ah! oh! dammit!  ah awww! \n",
      "no! \n",
      "a mountain lion! \n",
      "we cannot lose another member! shoot it! \n",
      "ah!\n",
      "all right, this! \n",
      "chef! \n",
      "a grizzly bear!\n",
      "oh my god... they killed chef.\n",
      "you bastards. you bastards!\n",
      "pity. he would have made an excellent child molester. \n",
      "maybe maybe he is still okay.  no, really. they say the last thing you do before you die is crap your\n",
      "pooot! \n",
      "oh never mind.\n",
      "come on, let's go. \n",
      "we are all here today because chef has been such an important part of our lives. a lot of us dongt agree with the choices chef has made in the past few days.  some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  but we cannot let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much chef made us smile.  i am gonna remember chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  i am gonna remember chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  so you see, we shouldngt be mad at chef for leaving us. we should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "he is right. \n",
      "and in the end, i know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of chef... that is still alive in us all. \n",
      "is it working? is it working?\n",
      "yes. we've got a pulse!\n",
      "get him in the icu suit! hurry!  we have done it! good! raise him up!  chef, can you hear me? say something.\n",
      "hello there, children. how would you like some salisbury steak?\n",
      "yes, go on.\n",
      "and for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?\n",
      "oh? you mean like a chocolate candy?\n",

      "yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he is better than everyone else.\n",

      "what?!\n",
      "come with me! \n",
      "there! look! \n",
      "smog? there's never been smog over south park before.\n",
      "dongt you get it?! when people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of selfsatisfied garbage into the air! that isngt smog, it is smug!\n",
      "smug?\n",
      "hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. you can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? glodal laming! thanks to your gay little song, south park is now the second smuggiest city in america!\n",
      "this is a south park news weather bulletin!\n",
      "it looks like we have a smug alert here in south park. our own keenan williams has the details. keenan?\n",
      "thanks, tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  all those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of park and jefferson counties. on the national map, we can see smug over denver and developing smug in los angeles. however, san francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.\n",
      "a smuggy day in san francisco town.\n",
      "sheila, did you meet gail and brian?\n",
      "no! hello, how are you?\n",

      "oh. sure. \n",
      "can you believe all these imbeciles in texas? they just put another prisoner to death. \n",
      "so... what do you do for fun?\n",
      "we drink and take drugs.\n",
      "do you want some acid?\n",
      "oh, no thanks. we dongt do that stuff.\n",
      "you will. there's a reason most san francisco kids take a lot of drugs.\n",
      "it is the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.\n",
      "everything okay in here, kyle?\n",
      "yeah, fine, dad.\n",
      "so much better here with the intellectuals, isngt it, boys?  wuhh  mmmm.\n",

      "marsh!\n",
      "oh crap, ranger mcfriendly.\n",
      "who?\n",
      "you'd better come with me to the news station! our situation just got a lot worse!\n",
      "i noticed it on the computer this morning. look here.  this is the smug over south park. it is... getting bigger and gaining strength.\n",
      "the smug?\n",
      "the smug is getting so massive that it is moving west... and fusing with the san francisco smug... here.  these two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  now take a look at this. \n",
      "what is that?\n",
      "it is the smug from george clooney's acceptance speech at the academy awards.\n",
      "george clooney's acceptance speech?\n",
      "did you hear it? he talked about how people in hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. he even took credit for the civil rights movement look!! the point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. the south park and san francisco smug is already at critical mass. if it gets hit by george clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. the perfect storm... of selfsatisfaction.\n",
      "we've got to tell the townspeople! south park still has a chance to make it through the storm!\n",
      "what about san francisco?\n",
      "kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a san francisco.\n",
      "soo, that is it people.  when the smug from george clooney's speech hits the san francisco and south park smug, we are gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.\n",
      "are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?\n",
      "if the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. \n",
      "this is all stangs fault! he wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!\n",
      "yeah. good going, stupid!\n",
      "listen! though we all agree this is stangs fault, there is still something we can do. if we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.\n",
      "then that is it. there's only one way to reduce smugness. we've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! \n",
      "everyone get your hybrid and meet at dawsongs! \n",
      "hey, where do you think you are going?!\n",
      "i am gonna try and warn kyle to get out of san francisco.\n",
      "oh no you are not! your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you are gonna help us get rid of 'em!\n",
      "how long do we have until the smug clouds collide?\n",
      "not long. the smug from george clooney's academy awards acceptance speech has already crossed into arizona.\n",
      "the hell is that? \n",
      "wow, eric. you sure are a great guy for doing this.\n",
      "i dongt have a choice. somebody has to get into san francisco and warn kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.\n",
      "but... how come we cannot just take the bus on into the city?\n",
      "you dongt know san francisco, butters.  it was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. those hardcore liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  i swore i would never set foot in san francisco. god help me.  all right, butters, i will be tethered to you through this cord. it is my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. if you stop hearing my voice, for the love of christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.\n",
      "i will. you are really great for going to warn kyle, eric.\n",
      "i am not doing it for kyle.  i cannot believe i am actually going to walk through san francisco. well, here it goes. \n",
      "all right. all right, now get it into the masher! hurry up!\n",
      "cannot somebody else operate this? i cannot really reach.\n",
      "well then you shouldngt have written that gay little song, shouldngt you have?!  keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! how are the smug levels?!\n",
      "they are dropping, slowly, but... but we are running out of time!\n",
      "yeah, it is like, san francisco is more of a european city, like paris or milan.\n",
      "butters, are you there?!\n",
      "i am here, eric.\n",
      "i've started to enter the smug. i am about a quarter mile in. can you give me an el?\n",
      "you must be nearing union square. did you see a fountain to your left?\n",
      "yes. it is just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.\n",
      "wait, uhh, eh take your next right. you've got to start heading west.\n",
      "turning right at o two four niner. \n",
      "that is it. that is that the last one.\n",
      "keenan? keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!\n",
      "harry, the smug from clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! get everyone inside!  god help us.\n",
      "butters?! butters, i think i am here! 2419 castillo?!\n",
      "that is it! eric, hurry! somethings going on out here!\n",
      "mr. broflovski! mr. broflovski, there a smug storm! we have to go!\n",
      "being smug is a good thing. \n",
      "oh my christ!  kyle? kyle!\n",
      "the acid. dude, i am totally tripping balls.\n",
      "i am totally tripping balls. i am totally tripping balls.\n",
      "we have to get out of here! now!  kyle! kyle!! \n",
      "and now, the worst appears to be over. last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. all across the midwest, people are picking up the pieces. cities like denver and south park are heavily damaged, but still all right. however, san francisco, i am afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.\n",
      "no...\n",
      "i am sorry, stan. i am sorry your gay little song killed your friend.\n",
      "hey! hey, stan! you are not gonna believe it! you've gotta come see!\n",
      "what?\n",
      "it is a miracle!\n",
      "kyle!\n",
      "hey stan.\n",
      "dude, what happened?? \n",
      "we dongt know. we were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.\n",
      "it is like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? \n",
      "dude, i am so glad you are not dead.\n",
      "so i guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.\n",
      "yeah. first off, we are all gonna need new cars.\n",
      "and let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? \n",
      "no! hybrid cars are a good thing!\n",
      "but hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?\n",
      "hybrid cars dongt cause smugness, people do.  look, hybrid cars are important. they may even save our planet one day. what you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.\n",
      "you mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we are better than everyone else because of it.\n",
      "yeah!\n",
      "i am...  i am not ready...\n",
      "i dongt think i can do it either.\n",
      "it is simply asking too much.\n",
      "perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.\n",
      "come on, everybody! let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! \n",
      "well, looks like you are back for good, huh kyle?\n",
      "yeah, i guess so.\n",
      "we just cannot get rid of you, can we, you sneaky jew rat!\n",
      "dongt belittle my people, you fucking fatass! \n",
      "ah, that is better. \n",
      "but the bubble gum prince wasngt afraid. he knew that the land of chocolate was safe forever and ever.  goodnight my little angel. \n",
      "staaan!!\n",

      "awww!\n",
      "how could family guy do that?\n",
      "why would family guy so blatantly insult muslims?\n",
      "because family guy doesngt care who they insult! they only care about their... precious money!\n",
      "oh come on, people. you really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??\n",
      "wuwe've got the tv working! \n",

      "gaaah! it is family guy! quick, gerald, do something! \n",
      "dad, dad, jesus christ!\n",
      "it is okay... it is dead.\n",
      "you boys know you are not supposed to watch that careless show!\n",
      "mom, it was nothing. mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.\n",
      "you boys dongt understand anything! it is obvious that you all need muslimsensitivity training!\n",
      "welcome to muslimsensitivity training. it is important for us to understand why the muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of mohammad.\n",
      "no, muslims cannot show an image of mohammad.\n",
      "kyle, you are not being very sensitive.\n",
      "yeah, kyle. maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us dongt.\n",
      "let's all look at why muslims are upset:  first of all, in the muslim religion, you are not allowed to have what?  sex. good.  there's no sex until marriage in the muslim world.  now, this would be fine except that in the muslim religion you also cannot... anybody?  jack off.  okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the muslim religion.  and what do we know about the places muslims live? they live in?  good, sand.  now put yourself in the shoes of a muslim. it is friday night, but you cannot have sex, and you cannot jack off. there's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. well you know what? i'd be pretty pissed off too!\n",
      "mrs. garrison, that is ignorant and racist! muslims are mad because of family guy, not because they cannot jack off! right, wendy?\n",
      "...yeah.\n",
      "attention students: proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!\n",
      "the hell's going on now?!\n",
      "shh! quiet, students, quiet!\n",
      "once again: we have just learned that the family guy episode featuring mohammad was only part 1 of a twoparter! and part 2 is going to air next week, with mohammad uncensored!\n",
      "what?\n",
      "why would they?\n",
      "fox studios claims that the family guy writing staff has demanded the mohammad character be seen in full view.  the head of fox had this to say:\n",
      "family guy is our biggest show. if they insist we dongt censor their work, then we we cannot.\n",
      "family guy!!!  i damn you to hell!!!\n",
      "once again, bitter riots have started in the middle east; this time, even more massive. and terrorist leader alzawahri has issued a threat\n",
      "seriously, 'family guy' isngt even that well written. the jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. when this episode airsour retaliation will be massive!!!!\n",
      "retaliation... oh my god. m'kay?\n",
      "goddamned family guy! now they are just provoking people! it is like they want a holy war!\n",
      "does this mean we dongt have school all week?\n",
      "you guys, this is serious! we have to do something!\n",
      "like what?\n",
      "we have to go to the fox network in l.a. we have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. you guys with me?\n",
      "dude, we cannot go anywhere. they've shut down the airports and the buses.\n",
      "then we will ride our big wheels.\n",
      "to los angeles?\n",
      "if that is what it takes, yes! we have to talk to the network! the family guy writers arengt gonna back down!\n",
      "well good for them. they shouldngt! the writers are standing up and saying they arengt going to be intimidated!\n",
      "intimidated?! is that what you think this is about, kyle?\n",
      "all right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! i dongt trust for one second that your sudden concern for the muslim people is real!\n",
      "all right, fine, kyle. forget the muslim faith for a minute. people can get hurt. if ten people die because family guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it is funny?  what if a hundred people died? will it be funny then, kyle?  i am going to los angeles. i am gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. somebody has to speak for the muslim people. somebody has to speak for that is right. \n",
      "kyle! kyle, wake up!  we have to go! the terrorists are attacking!\n",
      "dad? are you sure there's time?\n",
      "this isngt a joke, kyle! bombs have already gone off in six cities!\n",
      "no!\n",
      "wait a minute!  where's ike?!\n",
      "he was just here! ike!\n",
      "ike! \n",
      "ike? iiike!  ike! \n",
      "ice cream. i want chocolate.\n",
      "ike!  this way!  iiike! \n",
      "kyyyle!\n",
      "nooooo! \n",
      "come to try and stop me?!  it isngt gonna work. \n",
      "i didngt come to stop you. i... i think you are right, cartman. i want to help you get the family guy episode pulled.\n",
      "yeah well, i dongt need a partner on this.  especially one who doesngt trust me. \n",
      "look, cartman, i dongt know that is gotten into you, but... i i think it is pretty amazing. and i think it is real. you have to understand why i didngt believe you before.\n",
      "yeah. i do understand, kyle. i've been doing the wrong things for a long time. doing things for my own selfish reasons. i just wanna do something right, you know? just this one time.\n",
      "it is a long trip, dude. you are gonna need help. we can try and get the episode pulled together.\n",
      "you know we might not even make it into the studio.\n",
      "i know. but just like you, i feel like i have to try. people can really get hurt, and a joke just isngt worth that.\n",
      "so what made you change your mind?\n",
      "i got some sound advice... from an old friend. \n",
      "well kyle, we'd better get going.\n",
      "yeah! \n",
      "are you set?\n",
      "i am set! let's do this!\n",
      "all right, let's roll! \n",
      "people! people, quiet, please!  we must not panic!\n",
      "well what are we gonna do, mayor?! part 2 of the family guy episode airs in six days!\n",
      "i believe that professor thomas from the university has come up with a solution.\n",
      "thank you, mayor.  now look, everyone, muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what family guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. our only hope is to make the muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the mohammad episode. that even though the episode aired, we didngt watch it, we didngt hear it, and we didngt talk about it.\n",
      "so how do we do that?\n",
      "we bury our heads. in sand.  we take twenty to twentyfive dump trucks, fill them with sand from monarch lake, and then dump the sand along south park avenue. by using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. if we can manage to get every persongs head buried deep, deep in sand before the mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we are responsible for any part of this at all.\n",
      "no, no, wait a minute,  that is ridiculous.  what we need to do is just the opposite. freedom of speech is at stake here, dongt you all see?  if anything, we should all make cartoons of mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! look, people, it is... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. for the past few decades we havengt had to risk anything to defend it. but those times are going to come! and one of those times is right now. and if we... arengt willing to risk... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we dongt defend it. \n",
      "i like the sand idea.\n",
      "yeah, me too.\n",
      "yeah. the sand thing sounds a lot simpler. \n",
      "we are gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! let's move, people!\n",
      "we got six days to make it to los angeles. if we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.\n",
      "yes, and in just a few weeks from now, family guy will be off the air forever.\n",
      "off the air? but... we are just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled.\n",
      "it is simple television economics, kyle. all it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. if we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of muslims, then the catholics can demand a show they dongt like get pulled. and then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. and so on and so on, until family guy is no more! it is exactly what happened to laverne & shirley.\n",
      "whoa whoa wait a minute!  this isngt what i signed up for! i like family guy. why do we have to get it off the air forever?\n",
      "because they made ffun of muslims, and and that is wrong.\n",
      "but that doesngt mean it has to go off the air. you should like that show. your sense of humor is just like family guy.\n",
      "dongt you ever, ever, compare me to family guy! you hear me kyle??!! compare me to family guy again, and so help me i will kill you where you stand! \n",
      "you unbelievable son of a bitch. you never cared about the muslim religion. or the safety of people in america. you just want family guy off the air!\n",
      "do you have any idea what it is like?! everywhere i go, \"hey cartman, you must like family guy, right?\" \"hey, your sense of humor reminds me of family guy, cartman.\"  i am nothing like family guy! when i make jokes, they are inherent to a story! deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a point! not just one interchangeable joke after another!!\n",
      "what are you talking about?!\n",
      "you dongt understand!\n",
      "i cannot believe i let you scare me into taking your side. you used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.\n",
      "well... i guess you will not be helping me now. no biggie. i dongt need you to get the episode pulled! \n",
      "no!  i am not letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you dongt like off the air!\n",
      "well then kyle, i guess we ...oh my god, is that tim mcgraw?\n",
      "what?  cartman! \n",
      "kyle, stop it!\n",
      "holy crap! \n",
      "ahh!\n",
      "stay on 'em!  jesus, mary! \n",
      "if you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. \n",
      "dad, i dongt wanna bury my head in the sand.\n",
      "it is the best say, stanley. did you eat your fruit rollup?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "all right, make sure your snorkel is working.  all right, now get your head in the hole.\n",
      "dad, this is stupid.\n",
      "stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! do it!  all right sharon, now do me. \n",
      "uh professor, we all just thought of something. if everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last persongs head?\n",
      "yes. i am afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.\n",
      "i will do it.\n",
      "dylan, no!\n",
      "you realize by not burying your head in sand, you will appear to be a part of the family guy audience.\n",
      "yes, i know.\n",
      "dylan, please, you cannot!\n",
      "somebody has to do it, sarah.  you run along now and you get your head in the sand. i will be all right.  you have to understand... i am all she has. \n",
      "who are those people?\n",
      "no!  aaaah!  aaaah! \n",
      "hahahaha! so long, kyle!\n",
      "you son of a bitch! i will not let you win! you hear me?!\n",
      "suck mah balls, kyle! \n",
      "are you the network president?\n",
      "yes, mr. president.\n",
      "we need to discuss this family guy episode, mr. president.\n",
      "mr. president, my hands are tied. the family guy writers insist i dongt censor mohammad.\n",
      "but mr. president, this is a matter of national security. they must be reasoned with.\n",
      "mr. president, there's something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know. \n",
      "next week on south park: the race continues. cartman reaches the family guy studio and learns the shocking secret behind the family guy writing staff.\n",
      "this... explains everything.\n",
      "as an entire nation buries its head in sand... \n",
      "the idea has swept the nation! but where will we find enough sand for everyone?\n",
      "...and the battle between good and evil is finally waged...\n",
      "kyle, quit it! stop it, kyle!\n",
      "will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? will family guy be destroyed??? will television executives fight for free speech? or will comedy central puss out? tune in to see part 2 of family guy, next week, on south park!\n",
      "previously on south park...\n",
      "the popular cartoon, family guy, is going to show the image of mohammad uncensored!\n",
      "if we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this.\n",
      "i am gonna do whatever i can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.\n",
      "you just want family guy off the air...\n",
      "kyle, stop it!\n",
      "so long, kyle!\n",
      "you son of a bitch! i will not let you win!\n",
      "mr. president, there's something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know. \n",
      "and now, the thrilling conclusion of... cartoon wars... will not be seen tonight!  so that we can bring you this terrance & phillip television special \n",
      "say terrance, isngt it wonderful having a holiday here at the lazy \"j\" ranch?\n",
      "it sure is, phillip. but i do believe this steer i am riding has the farts. \n",
      "oh, look who's coming! isngt that mohammad, the holy prophet of the muslim religion? \n",
      "hey guys, how's it going?\n",
      "hello mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the koran.\n",
      "i am here to investigate a murder.\n",
      "all right, just what the hell is going on here??!!\n",
      "you censored out the image of mohammad in our television special!!\n",
      "ey! you guys know the rules! nobody can show the image of mohammad anymore. it is dangerous.\n",
      "but you ruined the whole show!\n",
      "look, i am not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  aw, come on guys, give me a break.\n",
      "we demand you rerun mystery at the lazy \"j\" ranch with mohammad uncensored!\n",
      "ey! i run this network, not you guys! and if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! no mohammad!\n",
      "but family guy is going to show mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!\n",
      "i doubt it! i will bet that right now, somebody is on their way to fox network to demand that that episode be pulled.\n",
      "ma'am, i need to speak to the president of this network right away.\n",
      "what is it regarding?\n",
      "it is regarding family guy. i demand that the mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! it is incendiary, it is offensive to muslims, and people can get hurt! it is wrong! it is wrooong!\n",
      "o...kay, but if you've got a problem with family guy, you will have to wait in line.  that little boy over there has an appointment to try and get family guy off the air altogether. \n",
      "dude, can i go before you?\n",
      "eat my shorts!\n",
      "what the hell is going on?  hello?  excuse me, i need to get to los angeles.  hello?! \n",
      "...starting in a small town in central colorado. the idea has now spread all over america.  muslims continue to riot in the middle east, demanding that family guy not air tonight's episode.  amd muslim terrorists continue to make threats.\n",
      "\"family guy\" better not show mohammad tonight. i am serious. \"family guy\" isngt funny.\n",
      "osama bin laden had this to say:\n",
      "if you look closely at the writing in \"family guy\", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and i think that is totally gay.\n",
      "bin laden went on to say that if family guy shows the image of mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. \n",
      "you one of them?\n",
      "who?\n",
      "how come your head aingt in the sand? \n",
      "so... you dongt like family guy either, huh?\n",
      "i hate family guy.\n",
      "so that is your plan? you are gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?\n",
      "not nicely.\n",
      "look, kid, if you hate a tv show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.\n",
      "cool, man.\n",
      "yes. so my plan is to use this whole mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. i am going to use fear to get them to do what i want.\n",
      "isngt that like, terrorism?\n",
      "...no, it isngt like terrorism. it is terrorism.\n",
      "i could do that.\n",
      "this is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.\n",
      "i am a pretty bad kid.\n",
      "really? that is the worst thing you've ever done?\n",
      "i stole the head off a statue once.\n",
      "wow, that is pretty hardcore. geez. that is like this one time, when i didngt like a kid, so i ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.\n",
      "you got it, man. you got it. \n",
      "seeya.\n",
      "i want to assure the american people that as president, i have exhausted every possible solution. unfortunately, mohammad will appear uncensored on family guy tonight at seven.\n",
      "mr. president!\n",
      "mr. president, cannot the writers of the show be reasoned with? dongt they know they are putting the country in danger? \n",
      "i have come to... understand something about the family guy writing staff. suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.\n",
      "mr. president!\n",
      "what exactly did you learn about the family guy writing staff, mr. president?\n",
      "i am afraid that information is classified.\n",
      "awww!!!  mr. president!\n",
      "mr. president, cannot you force the family guy writing staff not to write anything about mohammad? \n",
      "couldngt you throw them in prison? \n",
      "look! the fact of the matter is the family guy writing staff is protected by something called the first amendment!\n",
      "and what exactly is this first amendment, mr. president?\n",
      "uh you know, the right to free speech.\n",
      "awww!!! \n",
      "mr. president, when your administration came up with this \"first amendment,\" did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? \n",
      "well... we didngt come up with the first amendment. it was already in place.\n",
      "what do you intend to do about this \"first amendment,\" mr. president? \n",
      "forgive me, mr. president, but this \"first amendment\" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibberyjoob? \n",
      "yeah!\n",
      "that is right!\n",
      "okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.\n",
      "sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the family guy episode\n",
      "all right, let's get this over with. \n",
      "hello, gentlemen, ladies. my name is little danny pocket. and i will not take much of your time. please excuse my tiny crutch; it is the only way i can get around these days. ow...\n",
      "oh, poor kid.\n",
      "you see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of denmark. his newspaper showed an image of mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. i was in the lobby when it happened.  first one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. they just kept coming. suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! they were like mexican jumping beans. i just dongt wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  ow..\n",
      "i feel terrible. it is so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.\n",
      "sir, if we pull the episode, the family guy writing staff will refuse to work again.\n",
      "little boy, will you talk to the family guy writing staff? if your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they will back down from demanding we air the episode.\n",
      "i will certainly do my best.  ow.\n",
      "take this noble child over to the family guy offices. if he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the mohammad episode after all.\n",
      "yes, and then family guy is as good as dead.\n",
      "what was that?\n",
      "i i said \"thank you.\" thank you for listening. \n",
      "thanks a lot for the ride.\n",
      "ey, it is the least i could do. i hope you succeed, kid. i really dongt wanna see family guy go off the air. i love that show!\n",
      "i will do everything i can.\n",
      "i mean, i know it is just joke after joke, but i like that. at least it doesngt get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? \n",
      "excuse me.  do you know which way the network president's office is?\n",
      "who wants to know?!\n",
      "look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting family guy off the air.\n",
      "the network president's office is in there! \n",
      "oh thanks, dude.\n",
      "no problem, man. \n",
      "hello? this cannot be right, i  ow!\n",
      "cowabunga, motherfucker!\n",
      "hello mitchell.\n",
      "oh hi, miss travis.\n",
      "the president has asked that little danny pocket here speak with the family guy writing staff.\n",
      "are you... sure? they are working on a new episode right now.\n",
      "it will not take long, sir.  ow...\n",
      "all right, i will take him back. follow me, little danny.  you must be excited. not many people get to meet our writing staff.\n",
      "yes, i am totally excited. family guy is so funny.\n",
      "well, here we are. danny, the family guy writing staff.\n",
      "wha?  what are they?\n",
      "they are manatees.  gretchen and flubber are from the gulf of mexico. tinker, pete and lucy are from the caribbean sea.\n",
      "family guy is written by manatees?  of course, it all makes sense now.\n",
      "they really are brilliant creatures.  you see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls.  each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. there's millions of them.  the manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank.  uh there goes gretchen! she is coming up with an idea. oh, she came up with gary coleman.  the idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script.  laundry date winning mexico gary coleman. a perfect family guy joke! i can see it now!\n",
      "peter, you didngt do the laundry today.\n",
      "you think that is bad? remember the time i won a date to mexico with gary coleman?\n",
      "¿qué pasa, señores?\n",
      "whatchoo talking 'bout, willis?\n",
      "waitwaitaminute waitaminute. these... manatees demanded that mohammad be shown? how? manatees dongt talk!\n",
      "when fox censored the image of mohammad last week, it also meant that the mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. it made the manatees very upset. pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. hehere, i will show you.  keith?  all right all right, put it back in!  manatees are very ethical writers. either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.\n",
      "oh... yes, yes. um  hello, manatees. i, i think you should allow the network to pull your episode with mohammad. see, i am the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you\n",
      "that isngt gonna work on them.\n",
      "why not?\n",
      "dongt you know anything about manatees? they are the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.\n",
      "son of a bitch.\n",
      "let me out of here, kid! why are you doing this?\n",
      "well well well! \n",
      "cartman!\n",
      "hello, kyle. looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.\n",
      "you fat sun of a bitch!\n",
      "you came so close to stopping me, didngt you, kyle. there was just one thing you didngt count on: that more people besides me hate family guy.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "well, a lot of people like family guy too! who are you to decide it shouldngt be on the air?!\n",
      "shut up!  you shut your fucking face, man!  did it work? did you scare the network into pulling the episode?\n",
